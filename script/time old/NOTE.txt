# NOTE(kgeffen) The format of time is  100 entry array
# with each entry representing a single tic (turn).
# If a and b both act on turn 0, then array[0] = [a,b]
# A given unit only has its entry in one turn at a time
# but once that turn resolves, they are added to their
# next turn.
# For example ary = [[0],[],[1],...]
# Once current turn concludes, assuming that 0 has max speed:
# ary = [[0],[1],[],...]   then   ary = [[0,1],[],[],...]
